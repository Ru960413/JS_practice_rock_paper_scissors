      1. ask player to choose betwee rock, paper or scissors

      2. make the computer randomly pick between rock, paper, and scissors(by using a function?)
      3. have 2 parameters: playerSelction and computerSelection
      4. make it play once, using function playOnce()
      5. In what situations will the player win?
      6. In what situations will the player lose?
      7. return the results

      8. write a new function game(), and call for the function playOnce(), and keep scores
      9. let the game play for five rounds(loop the existing code using for loop)
