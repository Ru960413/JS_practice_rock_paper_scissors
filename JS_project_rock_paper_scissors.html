      1. ask player to choose betwee rock, paper or scissors
      2. make the computer randomly pick between rock, paper, and scissors
      3. have 2 parameters: playerSelction and computerSelection
      4. make it play once, using function playOnce()
      5. if player pick paper, and the computer pick rock, what will happen?
      6. consider all the possibilities, and declare whether the player wins or loses
      7. loop the existing code.
